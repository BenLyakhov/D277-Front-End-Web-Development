                <p> Washington State has it all: mountains, lakes, rivers. You name it, more than likely Washington has it. Washington state is also known as the evergreen state, because of the vast amount of pine and spruce trees that don't lose their green color, even in winter.
                <br>
                <br>
                Located in the Northeastern corner of the United States, it is part of a collection of state, which are collectively also known as the Pacific Northwest, or PNW for short.
                The Pacific Northwest offers very many appealing locations for hikers and backpackers, with the Cascade Mountains that run through the middle of Washington, and the Rocky Mountains which are located in Idaho and Montana.
                The PNW is known for its mountainous terrain, but it is also home to rivers, lakes and vast open fields and farmlands for any type of outdoor adventure.
